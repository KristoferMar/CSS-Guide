<h3>CSS position</h3>

The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
There are five position values<br>
<h4>Static</h4>
Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left and right properties. <br>
An element with 'position: static;' is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.<br>

<h4>Relative</h4>
An element with 'position: relative;' is positioned relative to its normal position. <br>
Setting the top, right, bottom and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left bt the element. <br>
